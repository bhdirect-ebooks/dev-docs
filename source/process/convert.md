## Navigating the Upload Process in VMWare (Windows)

Running _**npm run build**_ on the Mac-side command line (in the project folder of your book title) will add new directories and files to your project directory, and all these files are important for the conversion/upload process.

Working in the VMWare environment can be a bit tricky. Below are a few steps for avoiding obstacles that deal with permissions and other scripting requirements.

1. First, before opening VMWare, log into the Cisco AnyConnect VPN on your Mac-side.
2. Next, open the VMWare environment (for setting up VMWare and other Windows-side programs, check this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FCB8IKsH9g0CzzPEqyoobgxX2euKk-bVAxDnywGRIuA/edit?usp=sharing)).
3. Next, sign in to the Windows-side CiscoAnyConnect.
4. And finally, open the browser and use your sign in credentials to sign in to: [lifeway.okta.com](https://lifeway.okta.com/)
