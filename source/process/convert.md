title: Convert & Upload
---
Once a title has made it through the entire development process and has passed peer review, congrats! It's time to convert and upload files so that they are one step closer to availability in Wordsearch and <https://app.wordsearchbible.com/>.

## Navigating the Upload Process in VMWare (Windows)

Running _**npm run build**_ on the Mac-side command line (in the project folder of your book title) will add new directories and files to your project directory, and all these files are important for the conversion/upload process.

Working in the VMWare environment can be a bit tricky. Below are a few steps for avoiding obstacles that deal with permissions and other scripting requirements.

1. First, before opening VWWare, log into the Cisco AnyConnect VPN on your Mac-side.
2. Next, open the VMWare environment (for setting up VMWare and other Windows-side programs, check this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FCB8IKsH9g0CzzPEqyoobgxX2euKk-bVAxDnywGRIuA/edit?usp=sharing)).
3. Next, sign in to the Windows-side CiscoAnyConnect.
4. And finally, open the browser (Windows-side) and use your sign in credentials to sign in to: [lifeway.okta.com](https://lifeway.okta.com/)
5. Finally, sign (Windows-side) into to the <https://app.wordsearchbible.com> with these credentials:

## Partial

Occasionally you may need to upload an additional title/volume to a set which was previously converted & uploaded. The video below details steps to take in that instance.
