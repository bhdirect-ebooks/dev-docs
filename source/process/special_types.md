## LESSON<em>maker</em> Content
LESSON<em>maker</em> questions are most often found in Bible studies, study guides, and other titles that allow the user to enter their own notes or responses to questions.
The MyWSB platform prompts an entry-field for the user as one reads through a section of the book.

When creating markup, there are two broad categories of questions:

1. Panic questions: Panic questions are explicitly about the content of a verse or section of Scripture, and relate directly to the text itself.
  - *Example: "What does Paul say about the promise of God in verse 1?"*

2. General questions: General questions, on the other hand, can also be about Scripture but would deal with a reader's own reflections or thoughts on application. A general question would also, as the term implies, pertain to any other subject beside direct Scriptural study.
  - *Example: "How might you apply the lessons of verse 5 in your life, this coming week?"*


That's right. Particular. Special. Unique. Like a snowflake.
