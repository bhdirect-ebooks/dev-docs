Workbook enhancements are a feature in Content Platform (Wordsearch web app), and can be used wherever it is desirable to give the user a text box in which to record their answer to a specific question.

Here's an example of a Workbook-enhanced portion in an ePub:

For instructions on markup which will inform Content Platform where to index and display Workbook enhancements, see [Workbook Questions and Answers](/code/data_types.html#Workbook-Questions-and-Answers) in Recommended Code

We have established a shorthand-plus-script workflow to make adding workbook markup easier, see [expand-ws.js](https://github.com/bhdirect-ebooks/single-scripts/tree/master/expand-wb) for information.
