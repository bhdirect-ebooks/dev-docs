## LESSON<em>maker</em> Content

LESSON<em>maker</em> questions are most often found in Bible studies, study guides, and other titles that allow the user to enter their own notes or responses to questions in a (usually) weekly study format.

When creating markup, there are two broad categories of questions:

1. Panic questions: Panic questions are explicitly about the content of a verse or section of Scripture and relate directly to the text itself.

* _Example: "What does Paul say about the promise of God in verse 1?"_

2. General questions: General questions, on the other hand, can also be about Scripture but deal with a reader's own reflections or thoughts on application. A general question would also, as the term implies, pertain to any other subject besides direct mention of Scripture.

* _Example: "How might you apply the lessons of verse 5 in your life, this coming week?"_
