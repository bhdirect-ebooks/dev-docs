## Bible File Naming

Follow different text file naming conventions for Bibles.

For the main Bible content, do not use "chapter" in the file names. Instead, use the book [OSIS](https://docs.google.com/a/lifeway.com/spreadsheets/d/1tgzQru2dVaDU-zhaSfym1UuaPh3_Aktq91iDz9L9JtY/edit?usp=sharing) and double- or triple-digit chapter number corresponding to the Bible chapter. _There must be one text file for every Bible chapter._

For example, the name of the file containing the Genesis 1 in the New International Version would be named:

* NIV02_body0001_Gen01.xhtml

For the book of Psalms, use three digits in the file name for chapter numbers. For example, Psalm 22 in the Christian Standard Bible would be named:

* CSB02_body0649_Ps022.xhtml

With front matter and back matter included, it would look something like:

* CSB01\_front01\_cover.xhtml
* CSB01\_front02\_titlepage.xhtml
* CSB01\_front03\_copyright-page.xhtml
* etc.
* CSB02_body0001_Gen01.xhtml
* CSB02_body0002_Gen02.xhtml
* CSB02_body0003_Gen03.xhtml
* etc.
* CSB02_body1081_Rev22.xhtml
* CSB03\_back01\_appendix.xhtml
* CSB03\_back02\_appendix.xhtml
* etc.
