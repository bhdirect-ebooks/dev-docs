title: Welcome

Welcome to the B&H Academic eBook Development Style Guide and Manual! This documentation exists as both a replacement to existing handbooks and a major transformation to the way eBooks are developed by our team. While some aspects of eBook development remain the same (i.e., cleanup of files and basic markup needs), other aspects must change to move the process into the world of standards-based, accessible development.

Differences between the markup in this guide and that of previous handbooks stem from modern HTML5 standards, EPUB 3 specifications, and our goal of creating clean, consistent, and accessible EPUBs. Familiarize yourself with every part of this documentation, both the style guide and the instructions and examples that follow.

This document will be updated regularly as the process is refined and updated. You are responsible for understanding all aspects of the style guide and related documentation and for incorporating all recommendations into your EPUB projects. Likewise, you are responsible to understand and incorporate all future changes that will inevitably come. **Come back to this guide often as you develop content.**

Happy reading and developing!
