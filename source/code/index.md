Welcome to the Lifeway eBook Development Style Guide! The recommended code in this guide is an opinionated, standards-based implementation of EPUB specifications and represents progress toward our goal of creating clean, consistent, and accessible EPUBs.

Familiarize yourself with every part of this documentation, and expect regular updates and changes as the process is refined. As a developer, you are responsible for understanding all aspects of the style guide—including recommended code, CSS usage, and the development process and tools—and for incorporating all recommendations into your EPUB projects.

**Come back to this guide often as you develop content.**

Happy reading and developing!
