title: Git Commit Messages
---

Git commit messages are important since they communicate to other team members the changes represented by each commit. A good commit history also helps you to easily identify and correct any errors you may have introduced while working on a project. To enable good communication in a consistent tone across the entire team, use the following guidelines in your commit messages:

*  Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less.
*  Use lower case only (except for proper nouns), and do not end with a period.
*  Use an imperative tone to describe what a commit does, rather than what it did.
  *  _For example_, use **change**; not changed or changes.
*  When committing changes to resolve an issue identified in Review, follow the above guidelines, then include the fix verbiage after a semicolon.
  *  _Example_: `remove remaining InDesign classes; fix #1`
