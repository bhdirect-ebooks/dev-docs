## Abbyy FineReader 14

System Requirements blah blah. Installation blah blah.

**Abbyy Settings**

Once Abbyy is open, select "Tools" from the bar at the top of the screen, then select "Options" from the drop down. The following screen will open:

We will walk through the settings for the six tabs at the top: General, Image Processing, Languages, OCR, Format Settings, and Other.

_General_

The only setting we will look at on this tab is the first one: "When OCR Editor starts". Make sure "Open the last used OCR project" is selected.

_Image Processing_

Make sure the Image Processing selections are as follows:

Then click the "Show Advanced Settings button at the bottom. Make sure your settings look like this:

_Languages_

Typically, we want to have the first option, _Automatically select OCR languages_, selected. You can choose which languages the OCR software uses in its automatic selection and add them to the list.  The _Specify OCR languages manually_ option is for special cases in which unusual languages (such as Biblical Greek) need to be recognized.

_OCR_

Make sure the OCR settings are as follows:

![](/assets/images/uploads/toolsocr.png)

It is especially important that none of the boxes are selected in the **Detection of structural elements** section. If any of these boxes are checked, Abbyy will add unwanted structural elements to the document during the reading process, oftentimes making the document unreadable.

_Format Settings_

Make sure your Format Settings are as follows:

![](/assets/images/uploads/toolsformatting.png)

Make sure the Document type on the left is set to DOC(X)/RTF/ODT.
