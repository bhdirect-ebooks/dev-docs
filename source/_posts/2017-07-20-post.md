Make sure to familiarize yourself with the following changes:

* The [Headings](../../../../../code/structural_types.html#Headings) section is now located within "Structural Types" and includes guidelines for [Part](../../../../../code/structural_types.html#Parts) headings, with the new `.top-level` and `.part-1-6` classes
* [Review Process](../../../../../process/review.html) has the latest recommendations (_and we've removed everything covered by the latest release of stylecheck. Yay for less stuff to keep in mind!_)
* Some improvements to sections within [General Types](../../../../../code/general_types.html) in Recommended Code
* The [Dictionary](../../../../../code/dictionaries.html) section of Recommended Code is now complete
* Other minor changes, including the removal of all references to the deprecated `.ordinal` class
