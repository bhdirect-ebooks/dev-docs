We have released the new version of our default stylesheet alongside several changes to the default EPUB package.

The new stylesheet includes many new classes from the [Tachyons framework](http://tachyons.io/) to make content formatting changes much more efficient and flexible.

### So, what changed?

#### Recommended Code

* Fewer font files - there are now just 4
* One CSS file - mywsb-dev.css
* ***Title case is no longer required for headings***

#### CSS Library

* All codepens now use the new stylesheet.
* New [pull quote classes](../../../../../css_lib/quotes.html) have replaced the old. Use the new classes with `<blockquote>` only.
* There are a couple new [list classes](../../../../../css_lib/lists.html): `.lower-greek` and `.hebrew`
* Previous width classes have been removed in favor of [Tachyons width classes](http://tachyons.io/docs/layout/widths/)
* New sections have been added with links to the available Tachyons classes:
  * [Typography](../../../../../css_lib/typography.html)
  * [Layout](../../../../../css_lib/layout.html)
  * [Utilities](../../../../../css_lib/util.html) (colors, borders, & more)
