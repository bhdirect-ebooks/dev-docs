title: Say Hello to the New Style Guide!
---
It is the dawn of a new era. All problems are solved, and hope is restored to the galaxy.

Well... not quite. But this update is a long time coming and a welcome one that brings all style, code, CSS, process, and tool documentation together in one location!

### Changes:

**Removed outdated recommendations**, including:
  * LOI, LOA, LOV, LOT
  * `04_notes` and `05_glossary` files
  * tour type markup

**Updated guidelines to the latest recommendations** for:
  * `page-list` nav
  * footnotes
  * languages and transliterations

**Improved guidelines** for:
  * TOC
  * page breaks
  * images and videos

**And...**

* Restructured some of the content and moved multimedia content to its own section
* Removed references to old CROSS markup concepts
* Added many additional clarifications throughout
