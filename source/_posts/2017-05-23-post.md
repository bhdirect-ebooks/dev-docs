title: Style Guide Updates
---

This release incorporates all changes that support our new project directory structure and scripting needs:

## Process
  * [Project Admin](../process/project_admin.html) no longer includes creating the Git and GitHub repos.
  * The [Git and Github](../process/git.html) page is now just a general Git reference.
  * Triage has become [Project Scaffolding](../process/proj_scaffold.html) and has a video and details on the new project directory structure and the start-project module.
  * [EPUB Directories and Files](../process/epub_dir.html) includes a video and details for the new node split-files module.

## Code
  * [Constructing an EPUB](../code/construction.html) has the latest conventions for naming EPUB files and directories *(and removes the video.svg requirement)*.
  * [EPUB Metadata](../code/metadata.html) greatly reduces the number of required metadata elements.
  * The [Copyright Page](../code/structural_types.html#Copyright-Page) section outlines the requirements for special copyright page classes.
